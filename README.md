# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sasu8823

I’m an AI and systems master developer focused on building intelligent systems that scale. With a strong foundation in full-stack engineering, cloud infrastructure, and deep learning, I specialize in connecting robust backend systems with smart AI-driven solutions.

## 👀 I’m interested in
- Cutting-edge AI development (LLMs, generative models, RL)
- Systems architecture and optimization
- Distributed computing and scalable backend infrastructure
- Automation, DevOps, and MLOps pipelines
- Open source innovation and community-driven tech

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Advanced reinforcement learning applications
- Edge AI deployment and quantization techniques
- Privacy-preserving machine learning (Federated Learning, Homomorphic Encryption)
- Rust for high-performance systems

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- AI/ML-powered platforms or tools
- Next-gen developer infrastructure
- Applied research with real-world use cases
- Open source AI systems and model training pipelines

## ⚡ Fun fact
I write code that writes code. When I’m not debugging edge cases in deep learning models, I’m probably optimizing a system that’s running 10x faster than it did yesterday.
